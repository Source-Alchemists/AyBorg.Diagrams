# AyBorg.Diagrams

[![Quality Gate Status](https://sonarcloud.io/api/project_badges/measure?project=Source-Alchemists_AyBorg.Diagrams&metric=alert_status)](https://sonarcloud.io/summary/new_code?id=Source-Alchemists_AyBorg.Diagrams) [![NuGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/AyBorg.Diagrams.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/AyBorg.Diagrams/)

This is a fork based on the great work from [Blazor.Diagrams](https://github.com/Blazor-Diagrams/Blazor.Diagrams).

The purpose of this fork is to have a specialized Blazor diagram for image processing tasks rather than a general useable one. The project target is to be used in [AyBorg](https://github.com/Source-Alchemists/AyBorg).

If you look for a general usable Bazor diagram framework we recommend you to use [Blazor.Diagrams](https://github.com/Blazor-Diagrams/Blazor.Diagrams) instead of AyBorg.Diagrams.
