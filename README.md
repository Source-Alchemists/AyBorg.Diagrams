# AyBorg.Diagrams

This is a fork based on the great work from [Blazor.Diagrams](https://github.com/Blazor-Diagrams/Blazor.Diagrams).

The purpose of this fork is to have a specialized Blazor diagram for image processing tasks rather than a general useable one. This project target is to be used in [AyBorg](https://github.com/Source-Alchemists/AyBorg).

If you look for a general usable Bazor diagram framework we recommend you to use [Blazor.Diagrams](https://github.com/Blazor-Diagrams/Blazor.Diagrams) instead of AyBorg.Diagrams.
